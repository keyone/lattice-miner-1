# Lattice Miner v2.0

> **Lattice Miner** is a data mining prototype developed by the LARIM research laboratory at _Université du Québec en Outaouais_.  It allows the generation of _clusters_ (called formal concepts) and _association rules_ (including logical implications) given a binary relation between a set of objects (or individuals) and attributes (or properties).  The focus of Lattice Miner is on pattern (knowledge) _visualization_, _exploration_, _querying_ and _approximation_ through a lattice representation of either a flat or a nested structure. 

> Lattice Miner is public-domain Java platform whose main functions include all low-level operations and structures for the representation and manipulation of input data, lattices and association rules. The user interface offers a context editor and concept lattice manipulator to assist the user in a set of interactive and targeted data mining tasks. The architecture of 

> Lattice Miner is open and modular enough to allow the integration of new features and facilities.

> A new version of Lattice Miner will be released shortly to include facilities for _Web access_ facilities and for generating implications with _negation_, _generalized_ concepts and association rules given a _taxonomy_ on objects or attributes as well as _triadic_ (tridimensional) implications.
